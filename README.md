Typing Speed and Autocorrect Program
Overview
This project implements a program that measures typing speed and includes an autocorrect feature, inspired by Typeracer. The typing speed feature calculates how fast a user types a given text in words per minute (WPM), while the autocorrect functionality attempts to correct misspelled words in real-time after the user types them.
The project has been successfully completed, and the code is fully functional. Feel free to explore the repository to understand the implementation or contribute with improvements!
